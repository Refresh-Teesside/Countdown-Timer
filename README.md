Countdown-Timer
===============

At the Refresh Teesside events starting at 7pm we have an average of four speakers doing a strict 5 minute slot. We decided to build a timer which
we load onto a screen so that the speakers and audience know how long is left. We wanted it to be a little bit of fun and when the last buzzer sounds
that's the end! We have found that this works really well and has been well received by both the group and the speakers.

A simple website countdown timer for events.

* By default it starts at 5 minutes. You can change this.
* When the timer hits 1 minutes left - background changes to an orange/yellow colour.
* When the timer hits 30 seconds - background changes to red and a sound plays
* When the timer hits 0 there is a long buzzer
* You can click the page to make it full screen

Sorry guys but some of the html/css/js is a little messy.
